# Angular Boilerplate

This is a clean, intuitive, and fast starter project which contains a robust, maintainable, scalable, and agile architecture, allowing the developer to focus on the business logic and not on Front-end architecture matters.

The project’s main vision is to go for the path of free choice, this means the development is driven to go for the less opinionated solution and hoping for the developer who uses it to don’t have to change anything and use almost everything.

Something that highlights this project is that it gives flexibility to the developers that are using it to make different choices depending on their needs, which is very handy if you want to use this from a very small project to a really big one, and we will see this a little better on the next section.

Before continuing, it’s important to clarify that all the coding on this project is based on the standards, conventions, and good practices of every language that is used.
